<p>CEB Maintenance Africa is an I.T Managed Services company that specialises in the retail point-of-sale space. they support many retail chains within South Africa and across the African continent. </p> <p>My Role at CEB was within the projects team which would involve staging and rollouts of many parallel projects. This would include equipment end-of-life rollouts, mass software and OS upgrades, asset management, and scheduled preventative maintenance. I later moved on to the service department where I was a Field Services Engineer which involved engaging with customers and dealing with queries, troubleshooting and repairs of point of sale and back-office equipment. Through this role, I was able to establish a firm foundation in my IT career. Apart from the rapid technical learning experience the role also taught me soft skills, the ability to prioritise my work and time management.
